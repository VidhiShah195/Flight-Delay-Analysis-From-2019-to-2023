## Introduction



## Data Sources
Airline Flight Delay and Cancellation dataset sourced from the US Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics was used as it was available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023/data). The original dataset includes data that spans from January 2019 to August 2023, however for this project, I decided to focus solely on the data from January 2023 to August 2023 since it's the most recent available.
